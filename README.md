# VIX 2023 Data Reconciliation Project

> **NOTE!** This README was generated by ChatGPT. I've proofread it but mistakes happen with LLMs.

---

## Purpose

This project demonstrates a **full reconciliation pipeline** between two independently sourced datasets tracking the **CBOE Volatility Index (VIX)** for the year **2023**:

* **Kaggle dataset**: Publicly available VIX historical data
* **YFinance data**: Downloaded dynamically using the `yfinance` Python package

The goal was to **clean**, **normalize**, **diff**, and **control check** the two sources to identify any structural or value-based discrepancies.

| :------------------------------------ | :----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `vix_recon_2023_kaggle_vs_yfinance.R` | Full R script: ingestion, cleaning, diffing, control totals              |
| `loader.py`                           | Small Python script: pulled VIX data from Yahoo Finance for 2023         |
| `.gitignore`                          | Keeps virtual environments, cache files, and CSVs out of version control |

## Highlights

* **Column normalization** (naming, types, rounding)
* **Date parsing and alignment**
* **Inner-join diffing** (row-level, field-by-field comparison)
* **Anti-join checks** (missing dates between datasets)
* **Control totals analysis** (aggregate validation and drift detection)

Even though the datasets **matched perfectly at the row level** (no diffs within matched dates), a **\~2.67% drift** was detected at the **control total level**, likely due to:

* Different holiday handling
* Slightly different data availability across vendors

This real-world outcome is exactly what reconciliation projects aim to uncover.

## Key Technologies Used

* **R** (`tidyverse`, `janitor`)
* **Python** (`yfinance`, `pandas`, `dotenv`)
* **Git and GitHub** for version control
* **Basic environment management** via `.env` and `.gitignore`

---

## Notes

* Only **YFinance** was used for the live data pull (`loader.py`); Alpha Vantage loading was tested but not finalized.
* `.env` is ignored for security best practices (API keys not committed).
* Comments throughout the R script reflect the author's actual thought process and are deliberately written informally to reflect real development, not corporate polish.
